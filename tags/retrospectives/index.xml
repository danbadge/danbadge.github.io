      <description>The Product Development team at Driftrock has been using retrospectives for just over a year and it&amp;rsquo;s served us really well. In that time we&amp;rsquo;ve made loads of improvements and changes to how we work. Those changes range from small tweaks to our process to large uncertain ideas which we trial for a limited period. Our process for a retrospective is fairly typical (in my experience); we do them fortnightly and we rotate the facilitator role who runs the session how they see fit.</description>

      <description>Over the last year, Driftrock has been on a fairly typical journey - you might have heard it before - we went from manual deployments and an apathy for shipping software to automated and repeatable deployments with a focus on delivering value.
Rather then bore you with yet another post about the merits of Continuous Delivery, though I would like to, Iâ€™ll attempt to focus instead on how we achieved this shift.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Driftrock we&amp;rsquo;re a small company that has grown from 8 to 18 people in the last 9 months. That&amp;rsquo;s not excessive but it still challenged some existing methods of communication. One of those was how we communicate new features which have recently gone live, somewhere along the way we stopped doing this.

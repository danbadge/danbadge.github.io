      <description>There’s a feeling within my team at 7digital that we’re taking a long time to complete projects or features. Oddly this isn’t something we are currently measuring. We do though measure the throughput and cycle time of tasks. Tasks are items of work which the team create as a small iterative step towards a larger feature or story. This is useful for visualising the teams productivity, with the idealistic target of low cycle time and high throughput.</description>

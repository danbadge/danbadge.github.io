      <description>Finally I got round to reading Eric Ries’ well known book - the Lean Startup. This book often creeps into conversations and conferences so I was keen to see what was in there rather than relying on other’s insights.
From a developer point of view, it’s a fairly business-ey read as you might expect but there’s some great stuff in there and lots (and lots!) of examples from the technology industry as well as more traditional industries.</description>

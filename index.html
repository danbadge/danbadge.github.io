      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">February 2, 2021</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <a href="https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/">
          Over the years, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work in architecture roles alongside experienced software/technical/solution architects. Through observing others and my own trial and error, I&rsquo;ve learned a little bit about what not to do in these roles (because it&rsquo;s often easier to reflect on what didn&rsquo;t work rather than what did). Even though I lean towards the idea that everyone should be architecting the system rather than having architects solely responsible - I recognise that some organisations are far from that ideal, and it&rsquo;s those folks I hope find this list helpful...

        <a href="https://www.danielwatts.info/post/giving-and-receiving-feedback/">
          Recently I gave a brief lightning talk in our regular Friday all-hands meeting on how to give and receive feedback effectively. Whilst some of it was based on my previous experiences, most of it was pulled together from a few sources and people who have influenced me.
These are the notes from the presentation.
Why is feedback important? By providing each other with useful and more productive feedback we can help those around us...

      <div class="content">
        <a href="https://www.danielwatts.info/post/taking-retrospectives-to-the-rest-of-the-business/">
          The Product Development team at Driftrock has been using retrospectives for just over a year and it&rsquo;s served us really well. In that time we&rsquo;ve made loads of improvements and changes to how we work. Those changes range from small tweaks to our process to large uncertain ideas which we trial for a limited period. Our process for a retrospective is fairly typical (in my experience); we do them fortnightly and we rotate the facilitator role who runs the session how they see fit...

      <div class="content">
        <a href="https://www.danielwatts.info/post/journey-to-cd/">
          Over the last year, Driftrock has been on a fairly typical journey - you might have heard it before - we went from manual deployments and an apathy for shipping software to automated and repeatable deployments with a focus on delivering value.
Rather then bore you with yet another post about the merits of Continuous Delivery, though I would like to, Iâ€™ll attempt to focus instead on how we achieved this shift...

      <h2 class="subtitle is-6">December 29, 2016</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <a href="https://www.danielwatts.info/post/release-notes-at-driftrock/">
          At Driftrock we&rsquo;re a small company that has grown from 8 to 18 people in the last 9 months. That&rsquo;s not excessive but it still challenged some existing methods of communication. One of those was how we communicate new features which have recently gone live, somewhere along the way we stopped doing this.

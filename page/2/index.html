          Since February 2014 I’ve been working on the Content Discovery Team here at 7digital, we are responsible for every endpoint listed under Catalogue API here - http://developer.7digital.com/resources/api-docs/catalogue-api – and probably a few more. This is a mix of discovery endpoints and core catalogue endpoints often split by artist, albums (releases) and tracks. The discovery side of it consists of searching, recommendations, charts, genres, new and popular tracks and albums. The core catalogue endpoints are requests to the API for an album, tracks on an album, an artist, an artist’s releases or just track information using a 7digital unique identifier (referred to as releaseId, trackId and artistId)...

          There’s a feeling within my team at 7digital that we’re taking a long time to complete projects or features. Oddly this isn’t something we are currently measuring. We do though measure the throughput and cycle time of tasks. Tasks are items of work which the team create as a small iterative step towards a larger feature or story. This is useful for visualising the teams productivity, with the idealistic target of low cycle time and high throughput...

          Finally I got round to reading Eric Ries’ well known book - the Lean Startup. This book often creeps into conversations and conferences so I was keen to see what was in there rather than relying on other’s insights.
From a developer point of view, it’s a fairly business-ey read as you might expect but there’s some great stuff in there and lots (and lots!) of examples from the technology industry as well as more traditional industries...

        <a href="https://www.danielwatts.info/post/programming-is-like-football/">
          The title of this blog post makes is purposefully tongue-in-cheek, let me attempt to explain. As a kid football was everything, I played a ridiculous amount. Lunchtime and after school kickabouts, perhaps training twice a week and then two matches at the weekend. It was great and academia was not so great. I was a pretty average student – not the worst, definitely not the best and certainly not interested. So naturally I grew up and became a Software Developer...
